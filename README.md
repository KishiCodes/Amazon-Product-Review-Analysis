Comprehensive Excel Dashboard for Amazon Product Analysis
##  Project Overview 
This project is a comprehensive analysis of Amazon product data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset contains detailed product information such as categories, pricing, discount patterns, ratings, and users reviews. The primary goal is to uncover valuable insights about customer behavior, product performance, and revenue potential, then visualize these findings using a well-structured Excel dashboard. 
This project was completed as part of a data analytics course requirement and serves to demonstrate my understanding of data cleaning, pivot table creation, visual analytics, and storytelling with data.
